A number of additional comments are commented within my code.

To train and test the performance of the models, I used sklearn. I decided to test the following models due to the nature of the dataset.

1) Decision trees
2) SVM
3) Random forest
4) kNN

The characteristics of the assignment that I assessed in order to pick these models are

1) Size of dataset
2) Type of features (in this case we have all numerical features)
3) Classification
4) Output of classification (two categories)
5) Time available for assignment

For feature engineering, I attempted to normalize any features that were proportions or multipliers in order to standardize their values across the different counties. For example, since population growth is a function of total population, the actual change in population is a more informative feature. Performing this feature engineering allowed us to see an increase in the accuracy of the model (as well as a lower std in the cross validation)

Due to lack of time and processing power, I was not able to test the performance of linear SVM. I'd also like to have trained a multi-layer perceptron neural network and compare the results with what I got using the models I used.
